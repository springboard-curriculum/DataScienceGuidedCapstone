Big Mountain suspects it may not be maximizing its returns, relative to its position in the market. It also does not have a strong sense of what facilities matter most to visitors, particularly which ones they're most likely to pay more for. This project aims to build a predictive model for ticket price based on a number of facilities, or properties, boasted by resorts (*at the resorts).* \n",

    "Notebooks grow organically as we explore our data. If you used paper notebooks, you could discover a mistake and cross out or revise some earlier work. Later work may give you a reason to revisit earlier work and explore it further. The great thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can edit, add, and move cells around without needing to cross out figures or scrawl in the margin. However, this means you can lose track of your changes easily. If you worked in a regulated environment, the company may have a a policy of always dating entries and clearly crossing out any mistakes, with your initials and the date.\n",

    "**Best practice here is to commit your changes using a version control system such as Git.** Try to get into the habit of adding and committing your files to the Git repository you're working in after you save them. You're are working in a Git repository, right? If you make a significant change, save the notebook and commit it to Git. In fact, if you're about to make a significant change, it's a good idea to commit before as well. Then if the change is a mess, you've got the previous version to go back to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another best practice with notebooks is to try to keep them organized with helpful headings and comments.** Not only can a good structure, but associated headings help you keep track of what you've done and your current focus. Anyone reading your notebook will have a much easier time following the flow of work. Remember, that 'anyone' will most likely be you. Be kind to future you!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, note how we try to use well structured, helpful headings that frequently are self-explanatory, and we make a brief note after any results to highlight key takeaways. This is an immense help to anyone reading your notebook and it will greatly help you when you come to summarise your findings. **Top tip: jot down key findings in a final summary at the end of the notebook as they arise. You can tidy this up later.** This is a great way to ensure important results don't get lost in the middle of your notebooks."

    "`fastEight` has the most missing values, at just over 50%. Unfortunately, you see you're also missing quite a few of your desired target quantity, the ticket price, which is missing 15-16% of values. `AdultWeekday` is missing in a few more records than `AdultWeekend`. What overlap is there in these missing values? This is a question you'll want to investigate. You should also point out that `isnull()` is not the only indicator of missing data. Sometimes 'missingness' can be encoded, perhaps by a -1 or 999. Such values are typically chosen because they are \"obviously\" not genuine values. If you were capturing data on people's heights and weights but missing someone's height, you could certainly encode that as a 0 because no one has a height of zero (in any units). Yet such entries would not be revealed by `isnull()`. Here, you need a data dictionary and/or to spot such values as part of looking for outliers. Someone with a height of zero should definitely show up as an outlier!"

    "So far you've examined only the numeric features. Now you inspect categorical ones such as resort name and state. These are discrete entities. 'Alaska' is a name. Although names can be sorted alphabetically, it makes no sense to take the average of 'Alaska' and 'Arizona'. Similarly, 'Alaska' is before 'Arizona' only lexicographically; it is neither 'less than' nor 'greater than' 'Arizona'. As such, they tend to require different handling than strictly numeric quantities. Note, a feature _can_ be numeric but also categorical. For example, instead of giving the number of `fastEight` lifts, a feature might be `has_fastEights` and have the value 0 or 1 to denote absence or presence of such a lift. In such a case it would not make sense to take an average of this or perform other mathematical calculations on it. Although you digress a little to make a point, month numbers are also, strictly speaking, categorical features. Yes, when a month is represented by its number (1 for January, 2 for Februrary etc.) it provides a convenient way to graph trends over a year. And, arguably, there is some logical interpretation of the average of 1 and 3 (January and March) being 2 (February). However, clearly December of one years precedes January of the next and yet 12 as a number is not less than 1. The numeric quantities in the section above are truly numeric; they are the number of feet in the drop, or acres or years open or the amount of snowfall etc."

On a note regarding scaling to larger data sets, you might wonder how you could spot such cases when presented with millions of rows. This is an interesting point. Imagine you have access to a database with a Region and state column in a table and there are millions of rows. You wouldn't eyeball all the rows looking for differences! Bear in mind that our first interest lies in establishing the answer to the question \"Are they always the same?\" One approach might be to ask the database to return records where they differ, but limit the output to 10 rows. If there were differences, you'd only get up to 10 results, and so you wouldn't know whether you'd located all differences, but you'd know that there were 'a nonzero number' of differences. If you got an empty result set back, then you would know that the two columns always had the same value. At the risk of digressing, some values in one column only might be NULL (missing) and different databases treat NULL differently, so be aware that on many an occasion a seamingly 'simple' question gets very interesting to answer very quickly!"

    "How's your geography? Looking at the distribution of States, you see New York accounting for the majority of resorts. Our target resort is in Montana, which comes in at 13th place. You should think carefully about how, or whether, you use this information. Does New York command a premium because of its proximity to population? Even if a resort's State were a useful predictor of ticket price, your main interest lies in Montana. Would you want a model that is skewed for accuracy by New York? Should you just filter for Montana and create a Montana-specific model? This would slash your available data volume. Your problem task includes the contextual insight that the data are for resorts all belonging to the same market share. This suggests one might expect prices to be similar amongst them. You can look into this. A boxplot grouped by State is an ideal way to quickly compare prices. Another side note worth bringing up here is that, in reality, the best approach here definitely would include consulting with the client or other domain expert. They might know of good reasons for treating states equivalently or differently. The data scientist is rarely the final arbiter of such a decision.
