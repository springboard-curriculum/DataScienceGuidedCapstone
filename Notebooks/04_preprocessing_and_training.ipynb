    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** We began by extracting the data for our target resort to begin creating a machine learning model for out target feature: ticket prices.\n",
    "We first set up our training and testing splits while dropping 'Name', 'state', and 'Region' from the models so that we would only have numeric features.\n",
    "To start, we tested the mean as a predictor of average price. We calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) for this model and found that there was a variance of $19 when using the mean ticket price as our predictor.\n",
    "Continuing with our model training, we input the missing values of each feature with their respective median value, and then we scaled the data.\n",
    "Once these tasks were completed, we built a linear regression model that explained ~80% of the variance on our train set and ~70% on our test set. Calculating the MAE for this linear regression model showed that the estimated ticket prices were within $9 of the real price.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further explore and test our models, we went back and replaced the missing values in the dataset with the mean of each respective feature and found that the MAE and MSE fell in line with the model that used median values for missing data.\n",
    "We began to refine our linear regression model with SelectKBest to adjust for our model's overfitting, but realized that this approach would not work best for unknown/new data. To this end, we assessed the performance with cross-validation.\n",
    "We completed a 5-fold cross validation on the data and the results suggest that the model achieved a performance of around .6327 with about 95% effectiveness.\n",
    "The next step was to use the cross-validation with our linear regression model to find the best value for k in SelectKBest, which was 8. Further analysis into the data determined that vertical drop was our biggest positive feature, as well as Snow Making_ac, total_chairs, fastQuads, and Runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step was to create a random forest model. We completed the random forest model in a similar fashion to the linear regression model with and without feature scaling, and using the median and mean for the missing values.\n",
    "We found that inputting the median values for missing values was helpful, while scaling the features did not.\n",
    "The final results of this model showed that the top 4 features were the same as the top 4 in our linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models showed that there was value for a model that removed features that were not impactful and to have a simpler model. However, keeping a more full model will allow us to explore different scenarios with varying features.\n",
    "The random forest regression model had a lower cross-validation MAE than the linear regression model by about $1 and had lower variability. For that reason, I will go with the random forest regression model for future use in our ticket pricing model."
