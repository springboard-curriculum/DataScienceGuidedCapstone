    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

In simple cases with no feature selection or imputation or feature scaling etc. you may see the classifier or regressor object itself directly passed into `GridSearchCV`. The other key input is the parameters and values to search over. Optional parameters include the cross-validation strategy and number of CPUs to use."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Recall that the final ski_data dataframe was 277 rows and 36 columns. I partitioned the data into a 70/30 train/test split leaving 193 rows for the training and 83 rows for the test. I split the data into X and y groups with X being all ski_data columns not including ‘Adult Weekend’ and y being only ‘Adult Weekend’. I separated out the categorical variables (‘Name’, ‘state’, ‘Region’) so my X_train and X_test data was only numerical. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the first part of the notebook was to determine how good the mean adult ticket price is as a predictor. I found that the average price was 63.81 dollars using two methods: the pandas code for mean and the sklearn DummyRegressor with strategy = ‘mean’. I determined that I wanted to use R squared, MAE, and MSE as metrics to determine how good my guess is based on the mean. I learned that a model that perfectly predicts the observed values with no residual error would have an R squared =1 and a model that does worse at producing the mean will have a negative R squared. R squared is a good metric to understand the amount of variance explained. A metric to see how close my prediction is to true is the mean absolute error (MAE) - an average of the absolute errors. If I used the average ticket price as my guess, then I would expect to be off by around 19 dollars in price with a MAE on y_test of 19.136. The last metric I learned was mean squared error (MSE) - an average of the square of the errors. I obtained an MSE of 581 and a root MSE of 24 on my y_test. The MAE on this model for my test was 9.4 suggesting that my estimate ticket price is within $9 of the real price (which is better than being 19 dollars off when I used the average as my prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I had to figure out what I wanted to do with the missing values. My first experiment was to fill in the missing values with the median of each variable respectively. I filled in the missing values, trained the model on a train split, and made predictions on the model with both the train and test split. With this model I obtained an Rsquared of .80 on the training data and .70 on the testing data. This is already better than using the average as a prediction because my Rsquared value is closer to 1. An Rsquared that is larger in the train suggest maybe my model is overfitting somewhere. I did a similar analysis using the mean to fill in the missing variables and saw that it didn’t make a huge difference in the resulting metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then learned how to streamline the process by using sklearn pipelines with the goal to replace the missing values, scale the data to zero mean and unit variance, and train a linear regression model. I tested the pipeline created and saw that it produced the same output as my prior code helping me build confidence in using pipelines. I circled back to my thought that the model is overfitting and learned about the SelectKBest feature. I tried k =10 and k=15 features and both models actually proved to be worse at predicting with a lower Rsqured output. Instead of just blindly guessing k values to input, I learned about how to cross validate so that I can create a model that will be able to generalize to new data better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a model encompassing the pipeline and cross validation, I created a for loop to cycling through k in the range of 1 to all the columns in X_train. I mapped out the resulting mean and standard deviations in an error bar plot and noted that the best k = 8 features. Beyond 8 features the mean starts to drop and the standard deviation varies more suggesting overfitting of the model. I looked into the model with k=8 and saw that the best features that were selected with the first five being vertical drop, snow making, total chairs, fastQuads, and runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I tried out the data on the sklearn random forest model. I saw that the random forest model fitted the best features of fastQuads, Runs, Snow making, and vertical drop (all similar to the linear regression model). I tested the best linear regression model against the random forest model and saw that the random forest model had a lower MSE had exhibited lower variability suggesting that it is the superior model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I did a data quality assessment to see if I was using enough data for my analysis. It suggested that my CV scores level out around 40-50 samples which is well within my sample size. "
