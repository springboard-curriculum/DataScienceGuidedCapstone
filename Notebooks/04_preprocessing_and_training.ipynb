    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_.

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "## Summary Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The work in this notebook consisted of starting to build machine learning models that would pre-process our data in  `ski_data`, train them and test them. Our `ski_data` had **36 columns and 277 rows** from the previous work. Our target is to find an ideal ticket price for the `Big Mountain Resort` in `Montana`. We separated this feature from the rest, so the data we were going to train and test had **36 columns and 276 rows**. Using `train_test_split` method from  the machine learning package `sklearn.model_selection`, we split our data to a *70/30 train/test split*, that is out of 276 rows, we chose about *193 rows* to be used to train our model and the rest (about *83 rows*) to be used to test our model. We droped the feature `AdultWeekend` for adult ticket prices during weekends per resort for `X_train` and `X_test` obtained by applying the `train_test_split` method. For `y_train` and `y_test` we used the features `AdultWeekend`. We also did not need the 3 categorical features namely, `'Name', 'state'` and `'Region'`, so we droped them but saved them in a list to be used later. Hence the data we were going to deal with had **32 columns and 193 rows** for `X_train`, **32 columns and 83 rows** for `X_test`, **193 features** for `y_train` array, and **83 features** for `y_test` array, all of these features had  numeric features. Our baseline idea of performance, was a model that returned the average price. We wanted to subsequently, use our models against this to evaluate how efficient they are. By applying the `mean` method to our `y_train` array, we found that the average ticket price was  **63.811088082901556** dollars. A `DummyRegressor` method from `sklearn.dummy` applied to our training data gives a value of **63.81108808** dollars. How good is this match? The best way to evaluate this, is to use a set of three *metrics* namely, **Coefficient of determination (or R-squared), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. After writing functions that calculate R-squared, MAE and MSE separately, we applied these functions on our training and testing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The R-squared metric was 0.0 for the training data (this was obvious) and about -0.003 for testing data; since R-squared was very close to zero for our testing data, that means the model, predicts acurately the average price, but this this is not the best way to compare the predicted value and the actual value, the best metrics for this are the MAE and MSE.\n",
    "* The MAE metric was about 17.92 for our training data and about **19.13** for our testing data, which means for a known average value, the mean of our training data might be off by up to 17.92 dollars and more importantly our testing data might be off by 19.13 dollars or about 30%, which is not great!\n",
    "* The MSE metric was about 614.13 for the training data and 581.43 for the testing data; their square root values, which gives values in units of dollars were about 24.78 and 24.11 respectively, not good again because the values are not really close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using, the built-in functions `sklearn metrics` we got the same values for R-squared compared to the analytical values found above and values for MAE and MSE were very close or the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we bult any machine learning models, we had to deal with missing data in our train and test sets. We decided impute the missing feature values with the `median` of our data. Using the `median()` method, we calculated the median of each of the 32 features of our training data and imputed the missing values with the median in each feature of our training and testing data. As we did during EDA, some many features have different units and orders of magnitude, we scaled them using the `StandardScaler()`, `fit()` and `transform()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `LinearRegression()` method, we trained our model and found that about **81.8%** of the variance on the training data set, and **72.1%** of the variance on the testing data set, could be explained by our **linear regression model**. The low values of percentages, mean that our model would not be accurate enough probably because we are *overfitting* it. Using the `mean_absolute_error` function from `sklearn.metrics`, we calculated the MAE of our median and found it to be about **9.41** dollars which is much better than the **19.13** dollars from guessing using the average ticket price. So basically with this linear model, the predicted value of the ticket price would be only off by $9.41 of the real ticket price, also the MSE values were lower. But if we imputed our missing features values with the `mean`, how would this change our linear regression model? We checked this and found that although the imputed values were higher than those with the `median`, nothing else significantly changed: we still had the low percentages of variances on our train set and test set that our model can explain (**81.7%**, and **71.6%** respectively), and values of MAE and MSE were very close. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since one of  `sklearn` components named `pipeline` can impute missing data directly, we applied it on our linear regression model by creating a pipeline object by means of `make_pipeline()` function, then fitted the pipeline by means fot the `fit()` method and finally used `predict()` to make predictions on the train and test sets. This `sklearn`'s pipeline method yealded the exact same results as the methods we applied before to impute missing feature values. This allowed to only use pipeline method, either when improving our linear regression model or in our other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already knew (from the percentages of variances of the train and test sets that our linear model can explain) that our model was overfitting, we tried to fix this by using `SelectKBest()` method to predict the *k best features*. This first gaves us worse values of R-squared and MAE; the model could only explain about **76.7%** of the variances of the train set, and about **62.6%** of the variances of the test test. The MAE value was also about **11.20**, higher than the previous **9.41**. This is because by default, `SelectKBest()` uses *k=10*, which means that using 10 features is worse than using all features. We set the number of **k=15**, and there was a slight improvement in MAE which was **10.49** but still worse than the **9.41** value we got earlier, and the values of R-squared were still worse but improved(**79.2% and 63.8%** for the train set and the test set respectively). We did not want to continue guessing which value of k is best, because it's a bad practice. We sought to assess the performance of this linear model by using `cross-validation` technique. The cross-validation of the linear regression model had a mean score of **63.27%** accuracy with standard daviation of **0.095**; this score was not great. Cross-validating the linear regression model showed that the best 8 features that can be used to predict the ideal ticket price. The very best being the `vertical_drop` with a linear regression coefficient of **10.767857**, the four best features that follow were `Snow Making_ac`, `total_chairs` , `fastQuads` and `Runs`, with linear regression coefficients of **6.290074, 5.794156, 5.745626, and 5.370555**  respectively. Most of these features if not all, were predicted during our EDA. Overall, performing the MAE on our cross-validated linear regression model,  we got a value of about **10.50**, that is overall our linear regression model would predict a value of a ticket price that would be off by up to **10.50** dollars, this is an improvement from the mean model (where the value was **11.13** dollars).\n",

    "We finally checked how well the `Random Forest Model` would work and if it would be better than the `Linear Regression Model`. We used the `RandomForestRegressor()` method to call on random forest model. Like in linear regression model, we used `make_pipeline()` to make a pipeline. The cross-validation of tha random forest model had a mean score of **69.76%** accuracy with **0.071** standard deviation. This mean score of CV was an improvement from that of the cross-validated linear regression model. The cross-validation of the model showed that the four best features that can be used to predict the ideal ticket price, namely: `fastQuads`, `Runs`, `Snow Making_ac`, and `vertical_drop` in descending order as shown in the figure below,\n",

    "Overall, performing the MAE on our cross-validated random forest  model,  we got a value of about **9.64**, that is overall our random forest model would predict a value of a ticket price that would be off by up to **9.64** dollars; an improvement from the linear regression model (which was **10.50** dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, we decided to use the random forest model, since its cross-validation yields better mean score accuracy (**69.76%** vs **63.27%**), but mainly since its cross-validated mean absolute error value was lower by almost $1 (**9.64** vs **10.50**). \n"
