    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

Clearly you are onto something, although the much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat.

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way around this is a technique called _cross-validation_. You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "In this preprocessing step, we first evaluated the usefulness of the mean value as a predictor. we then compared imputing missing values with both the median and mean approaches and assessed their performance using a linear regression model. Interestingly, the choice of imputation method (median or mean) didn't have a significant impact on the model's accuracy. On average, the model could estimate a ticket price within approximately 9 dollars of the actual price, which was much better than a simple guess based on the average value (with a variance of 19 dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we employed a pipeline that involved imputing missing values, scaling the data, and performing linear regression in a single process. To identify the most influential/dominant features, we utilized the `select k best` strategy. After experimenting with setting different values of K, we did a hyperparameter search using GridSearchCV and found that 8 was the best value for k (8 number of features). The top 8 features that the linear regression model identified as the most important for predicting ticket prices were: `vertical_drop`, `Snow Making_ac`, `total_chairs`, `fastQuads`, `Runs`, `LongestRun_mi`, `trams`, and `SkiableTerrain_ac`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, we explored the random forest model using cross-validation and found that it aligned with the linear model, highlighting the importance of four features: `fastQuads`, `Runs`, `Snow Making_ac`, and `vertical_drop`.\n",
    "Comparing the performance of the `linear regression` and `random forest models`, we observed that the random forest model exhibited a lower cross-validation mean absolute error, almost 1 dollar less. As a result, we conclude that the preferred choice for this project is the `random forest model`, selected for its superior stability and lower cross-validation mean absolute error.\n",

    "Validating the performance on the test set yielded consistent results, affirming the reliability and effectiveness of the random forest model for predicting ticket prices."
