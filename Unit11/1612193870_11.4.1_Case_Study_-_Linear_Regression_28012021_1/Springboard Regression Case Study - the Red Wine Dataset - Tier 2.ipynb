    "Welcome to the Springboard Regression case study! Please note: this is ***Tier 2*** of the case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study was designed for you to **use Python to apply the knowledge you've acquired in reading *The Art of Statistics* (hereinafter *AoS*) by Professor Spiegelhalter**. Specifically, the case study will get you doing regression analysis; a method discussed in Chapter 5 on p.121. It might be useful to have the book open at that page when doing the case study to remind you of what it is we're up to (but bear in mind that other statistical concepts, such as training and testing, will be applied, so you might have to glance at other chapters too).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to ***use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible***. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll try a *univariate* analysis (one involving a single explanatory variable) as well as a *multivariate* one (involving multiple explanatory variables), and we'll iterate together towards a decent model by the end of the notebook. The main thing is for you to see how regression analysis looks in Python and jupyter, and to get some practice implementing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this case study, **questions** will be asked in the markdown cells. Try to **answer these yourself in a simple text file** when they come up. Most of the time, the answers will become clear as you progress through the notebook. Some of the answers may require a little research with Google and other basic resources available to every data scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we're going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. Make sure it's downloaded and sitting in your working directory. This is a very common dataset for practicing regression analysis and is actually freely available on Kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset).\n",

Almost always, we can only determine which variables are sensible choices for dependent variables with some **domain knowledge**. \n",

Wines lacking in acid are \"flat.\" Chemically the acids influence titrable acidity which affects taste and pH which affects  color, stability to oxidation, and consequantly the overall lifespan of a wine.'\n",
