    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London [(here's some info for the curious)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Tier Two notebook. Don't sweat it if you got stuck on the highest difficulty. You'll have a lot more guidance this time around. If you get stuck again, you can always drop down to Tier One. Just remember to come back around and redo the project on the higher difficulty.\n",

    "- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n",
